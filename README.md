* Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

 - Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes

 - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  
 - The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
